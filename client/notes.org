* Tavis's Notes

** TODO
- graph the metrics
- add something that generates UI events
- add some state machine that consumes both UI events and 
  the request metrics
- enable on/off control of the metrics ws subscription


** very rough initial brainstorm / notes on my talk:
- what is an event?
- define effects
- steams, sequences, pipes: iterables vs observables
- event streams are equivalent to input/output simplicity benefits of FP
- easy to understand, compose, debug and much more
- don't think of Rx as a way to chain callbacks!
- and for fuck's sake don't design by callback chaining
- better metaphors:
  - it is a means to plumb event pipelines together
  - treat async events like collections
  - transform / compose (zip, selectMany, merge) / query (where, any)
  - time handling: buffer, throttle, window functions
  - Rx provides gears like a machine to transform your input events into either
    - output events
    - or effects (.subscribe)
- separation of concerns: intent/behaviour, interface/implementation, event/reaction
- system state is a derived from events (ui, network, whatever) that have occurred
- learn to think in state machines
- frp / uis
- deterministic replay of non-deterministic original event stream
- a bit about React.js and how it's V-only philosophy fits well with what I've said
  and with Rx
